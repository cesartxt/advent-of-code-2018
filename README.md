# Advent of code

Solutions for some of the 'Advent of Code' 2018 edition puzzles.

Each puzzle solution has its own Java file inside the folder:

 `src/main/java/org/cesartxt/adventofcode`

Each Java file has a name with the prefix `Day` followed by the number of the corresponding puzzle.

The Main class located in  `src/main/java/org/cesartxt/adventofcode` runs all the solutions. It reads each puzzle input files located in `src/main/resources`. The name of the input files starts with the prefix `day` followed by the number of the puzzle.

## How to run all the solutions?
The solutions are coded in Java. You should have installed JDK 8 or a superior version to execute them.

### Mac/Linux Instructions
Run `./gradlew run` in Terminal/shell from the project directory

### Windows Instructions
 Run `.\gradlew.bat run` in a command prompt from the project directory


The above instructions execute the `Main` java class located in `src/main/java/org/cesartxt/adventofcode` and run all the solved puzzles.
